<h2>The purpose</h2> 
The main goal of this project is to create a space where I can hold and showcase any work I make in the future.<br>
I have been prompted to create this site as part of my course with the learning people and have decided to make it into a place where I could demonstrate my skills and tell people about me, a bit like an online CV. 

<h2>The process</h2>
The moment that I read the Brief <i>(that I have added in the Reop)</i> I had a bit of a vision, though I will admit that this has changed during development, I knew that I wanted a continuous page with three distinct parts and what each section would be used for as well as ideas for colours and layout. though the colours and images have been changed from what I had originally planned, I mostly stayed true to the plan.

<h2>The future</h2>
My plans moving forward is to not only add in more pieces of work but also to add in a new page that links from the carousel to show all of my other works in tiles that when clicked will open the sites in a new tab. As well as potentially adding in an option for a light or dark theme using javascript so people can choose which option is better for them.
<br>I am also planning to rewrite the CSS into SASS so that I review it easier in the future.
